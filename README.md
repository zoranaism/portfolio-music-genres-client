## Goals for this project

The goal of this project is to build a full-stack app using new technologies (see above) _not taught in the bootcamp_. I learned these new tools by reading documentations and watching tutorial videos.

- practice full-stack development
- practice learning new technology independently
- apply what we learned in the bootcamp
- showcase development approach of using wireframes and user stories
- practice disciplined [git usage](#git-workflow)
